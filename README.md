# Food Facilities Challenge

This repository contains my solution to the Food Facilities Challenge, based on public data from SF Open Data – Mobile Food Facility Permits.

The goal of this project is to build an application that enables users to explore mobile food vendors in San Francisco through powerful search and geolocation features.



## Implementations
Both backend and frontend implementations are included:

- [ /frontend ](./frontend) – A React-based frontend that consumes the backend API and displays results on an interactive map.
- [/backend](./backend) – A FastAPI application following Clean Architecture principles.
